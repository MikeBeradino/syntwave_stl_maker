Synthwave Low-Poly Terrain Generator & STL Viewer



A Python + Tkinter desktop app for creating low-poly synthwave-style terrain with built-in 3D preview and binary STL export.
Features forced-perspective mountains: large foreground peaks, smaller distant ridge, and tapering side walls to enhance depth.

✨ Features

Interactive GUI – adjust size, density, and style with sliders & number boxes.

Forced perspective shaping – larger mountains in front, smaller at the horizon.

Side walls – strong near the viewer, fade toward the horizon.

Valley flattening – central low area for classic synthwave grids or roads.

Low-poly control – adjust polygon count for chunkier or smoother results.

Built-in 3D STL viewer – rotate, pan, zoom in real-time.

Binary STL export – clean, closed mesh with flat base for 3D printing.

🖥️ Requirements

Python 3.8+

No external dependencies – uses only the Python standard library.
